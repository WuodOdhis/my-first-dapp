I want to be a good programmer who can actually build things.
I am good at understanding various concepts in web3 but I have no building experience.
Money is actually the main motivator here. I know what im capable of achieving if I get good at this.
I aim to be millionaire by the end of the year.
So it depends entirely on the amount of work I put in.
So i have to get serious and complete this course no matter the hurdles.
